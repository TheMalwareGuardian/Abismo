This repository originally hosted early research notes and proof-of-concept prototypes, which laid the foundation for what has become the **[Abyss Windows UEFI Bootkit](https://github.com/TheMalwareGuardian/Abyss)**, to be presented during our upcoming **[DEF CON 33 Main Stage Talk](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-33/dc-33-speakers.html#content_60321)**.

- To prepare for the release, the earlier resources have been removed so the updated, clean version of the project can be published here on the day of the talk without conflicts.  
- After the talk, this repository will be updated with the exact version of the project presented at DEF CON, for archival and reference purposes.  

**Ongoing development and future updates will continue exclusively in the official [Abyss repository](https://github.com/TheMalwareGuardian/Abyss).**
