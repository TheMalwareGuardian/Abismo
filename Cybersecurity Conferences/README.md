# ***🎤 Cybersecurity Conferences***

Although ***DEF CON 33*** was the main stage for the release of the Abyss framework, many of the core ideas, especially those related to UEFI bootkits and early-stage system compromise, were presented throughout 2024 in earlier conferences. These talks laid the foundation for what Abyss would eventually become.

## ***🧬 Bootkit Research Origins***

### **🎙️ RootedCON Madrid 2024**

- ***At the Roots of Evil: Diving into UEFI Bootkit Development***

My first-ever public talk, where I introduced how to build a basic UEFI bootkit. The session covered tampering with the Windows boot chain - including Boot Manager and OS Loader - and featured a live demo showing an early DSE bypass mechanism.

### **🎙️ ViCONgal 2024**

- ***The New Era of Bootkits: Persistence and Evasion from the Core***

This presentation expanded upon the RootedCON content by exploring bootkit architecture in more depth. It introduced stealth techniques through UEFI service hooking and demonstrated how to stage payloads for deployment during the boot process.

### **🎙️ Cybersecurity Day 2024**

- ***Exploring Advanced Threats Between Boot and Kernel: Bootkits and Rootkits***

Focused on real-world scenarios where attackers compromise firmware to gain early execution. It showcased how a UEFI bootkit can serve as an entry point for deeper kernel control and persistent access.
