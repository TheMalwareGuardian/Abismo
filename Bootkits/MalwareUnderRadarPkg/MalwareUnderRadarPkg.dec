# This file is used to declare what is available in the package and tells the build system where to find things such as "Include" directories. It can also be used to replace the use of #define values or constant variables in .h files though a mechanism called the Platform Configuration Database(PCD). This file is used when a module includes this package in its [Packages] section.
