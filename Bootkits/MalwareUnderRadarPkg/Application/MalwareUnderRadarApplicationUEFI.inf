  BASE_NAME                      = MalwareUnderRadarApplicationUEFI             # Defines the base output name of the module (application, library, etc...) when built resulting in the final .efi or .lib binary.

# List the various packages the module will use. This tells the build system where to look for library classes (header files for the library), PCDs, GUIDs, Protocols, and PPIs via the different packages .DEC files. The .DCS file from this package is not used. Typically minimum required package is the MdePkg.dec
[Packages]
  MalwareUnderRadarPkg/MalwareUnderRadarPkg.dec                                 # Main package for the Abismo Bootkit project.
  MdePkg/MdePkg.dec                                                             # The Module Development Environment Package (MdePkg) is a special package as it is the minimum infrastructure required to build a module.
  MdeModulePkg/MdeModulePkg.dec                                                 # This package provides the modules that conform to UEFI/PI Industry standards. It also provides the defintions(including PPIs/PROTOCOLs/GUIDs and library classes) and libraries instances, which are used for those modules.
  NetworkPkg/NetworkPkg.dec                                                     # Network Package.


# List the various source and header files used to build the module.

# List the various libraries the module uses and should be linked with. This is the LibNameToReference value the library module used in its .INF file. For each entry in this section there needs to be an entry [LibraryClasses] sector of the .DSC file this module is associated with. This is because the packages in the [Packages] section are not used to determine the library module to link with.

# List the various protocol GUIDs variable name needed/used by the sources. The variable name is defined in one of the [Packages].DEC [Guids] section. Also listed are the Usage Block definitions for the protocol for this module.
[Protocols]
  gEfiLoadedImageProtocolGuid
  gEfiSimpleFileSystemProtocolGuid
  gEfiHttpServiceBindingProtocolGuid
  gEfiHttpProtocolGuid
  gEfiSimpleTextOutProtocolGuid
  gEfiSimpleTextInProtocolGuid

# List the various GUIDs variable name needed/used by the sources. The variable name is defined in one of the [Packages].DEC [Guids] section. The usage block SOMETIMES_PRODUCES and guide type UNDEFINED Means that the module will produce a GUID that does not fit into the defined PROTOCOL or PPI types. This module conditionally produces the named GUID.
