# 🖥️ PowerShell Script for Automating Bootkits/Rootkits Development Environment Setup in Windows

This PowerShell script is meticulously crafted to automate the setup of a development environment specifically tailored for creating [UEFI](https://wiki.osdev.org/UEFI) Bootkits and [Kernel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/) Rootkits on Windows. It streamlines the otherwise manual and time-consuming tasks of installing necessary tools and configuring [TianoCore](https://www.tianocore.org/) [EDK2](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2) (EFI Development Kit) and [WDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk) (Windows Driver Kit), allowing developers to focus more on bootkits/rootkits innovation and less on setup 😉.

1. Open PowerShell.
2. Navigate to the folder containing the script.
3. Execute the script by entering: `.\Setup_Development_Environment.ps1`
