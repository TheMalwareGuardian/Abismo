/**
    Performs a case-insensitive comparison of two ASCII strings with a specified length.

    This function compares two ASCII strings, FirstString and SecondString, up to the specified Length characters. The comparison is case-insensitive. If FirstString is equal to SecondString, it returns 0. If FirstString is less than SecondString, it returns a negative value. If FirstString is greater than SecondString, it returns a positive value.

    @param[in]	FirstString		A pointer to the first ASCII string.
    @param[in]	SecondString	A pointer to the second ASCII string.
    @param[in]	Length			The maximum number of characters to compare.

    @retval		0				The two strings are equal up to Length characters.
    @retval		Negative		FirstString is less than SecondString.
    @retval		Positive		FirstString is greater than SecondString.
