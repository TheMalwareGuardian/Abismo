/**
	Disables the Driver Signature Enforcement protection for the duration of the boot by preventing it from initializing.

	This function takes a PE image represented by its ImageBase, NtHeaders, and PageSection, and disables the Driver Signature Enforcement protection. The Driver Signature Enforcement is a security feature that restricts the loading of unsigned or improperly signed drivers in Windows.

	The actual heart of Code Integrity lies inside a single executable image, called CI.dll (you can find it inside your \Windows\system32 directory). If we take a look at the list of imported symbols, we will most likely see the following names: CiCheckSignedFile, CiFindPageHashesInCatalog, CiFindPageHashesInSignedFile, CiFreePolicyInfo, CiGetPEInformation, CiInitialize, CiVerifyHashInCatalog. The first function within our interest is the initialization routine, CI!CiInitialize. This routine is imported by the NT core (ntoskrnl.exe), and called during system initialization

	@param[in]		ImageBase					The base address of the PE image.
	@param[in]		NtHeaders					A pointer to the PE image's NT headers.
	@param[in]		PageSection					A pointer to the section header of the PE image.
	@param[in]		BuildNumber					The build number of the operating system.

	@retval			EFI_SUCCESS					The Driver Signature Enforcement protection was successfully disabled.
	@retval			EFI_UNSUPPORTED				The function is not supported on the provided PE image.
	@retval			EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER		One or more of the input parameters are invalid.
	@retval			EFI_NOT_FOUND				The required data or structures were not found in the PE image.
